## Features

<div class="two-column">

<div class="featurebox">
### Find places by name or address (Geocoding)

Nominatim can power the search box on your website, allowing your users
to type free-form queries ("Cafe Paris, New York") in any language.
It also offers a structured query mode
("postcode=12345", "city=London", "type=cafe")
that helps you to automate geocoding of extensive address lists.
</div>


<div class="featurebox">
### Look up addresses for a location (Reverse geocoding)

Given a latitude and longitude anywhere on the planet, Nominatim can find the
nearest address. It can do the same for any OSM object
given its ID.
