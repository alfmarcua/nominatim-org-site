The tmp folder is used for import dump. Configuring multiple regions \uf0c1 The file import_multiple_regions.sh needs to be edited as per your requirement: List of countries. eg: COUNTRIES=\"europe/monaco europe/andorra\" Path to Build directory. eg: NOMINATIMBUILD=\"/srv/nominatim/build\" Path to Update directory. eg: UPDATEDIR=\"/srv/nominatim/update\" Replication URL. eg: BASEURL=\"https://download.geofabrik.de\" DOWNCOUNTRYPOSTFIX=\"-latest.osm.pbf\" Tip If your database already exists and you want to add more countries, replace the setting up part ${SETUPFILE} --osm-file ${UPDATEDIR}/tmp/combined.osm.pbf --all 2>&1 with ${UPDATEFILE} --import-file ${UPDATEDIR}/tmp/combined.osm.pbf 2>&1 . Setting up multiple regions \uf0c1 Run the following command from your Nominatim directory after configuring the file. bash ./utils/import_multiple_regions.sh Important This file uses osmium-tool. It must be installed before executing the import script. Installation instructions can be found here . Updating multiple regions \uf0c1 To import multiple regions in your database, you need to configure and run utils/update_database.sh . This uses the update directory set up while setting up the DB.

Updating the database \uf0c1 Run the following command from your Nominatim directory after configuring the file. bash ./utils/update_database.sh This will get diffs from the replication server, import diffs and index the database. The default replication server in the script( Geofabrik ) provides daily updates. Importing Nominatim to an external PostgreSQL database \uf0c1 You can install Nominatim using a database that runs on a different server when you have physical access to the file system on the other server. Nominatim uses a custom normalization library that needs to be made accessible to the PostgreSQL server. This section explains how to set up the normalization library. Option 1: Compiling the library on the database server \uf0c1 The most sure way to get a working library is to compile it on the database server. From the prerequisites you need at least cmake, gcc and the PostgreSQL server package. Clone or unpack the Nominatim source code, enter the source directory and create and enter a build directory. cd Nominatim mkdir build cd build Now configure cmake to only build the PostgreSQL module and build it: cmake -DBUILD_IMPORTER=off -DBUILD_API=off -DBUILD_TESTS=off -DBUILD_DOCS=off -DBUILD_OSM2PGSQL=off .. make When done, you find the normalization library in build/module/nominatim.so . Copy it to a place where it is readable and executable by the PostgreSQL server process. Option 2: Compiling the library on the import machine \uf0c1 You can also compile the normalization library on the machine from where you run the import. Important You can only do this when the database server and the import machine have the same architecture and run the same version of Linux. Otherwise there is no guarantee that the compiled library is compatible with the PostgreSQL server running on the database server. Make sure that the PostgreSQL server package is installed on the machine with the same version as on the database server . You do not need to install the PostgreSQL server itself. Download and compile Nominatim as per standard instructions. Once done, you find the nomrmalization library in build/module/nominatim.so . Copy the file to the database server at a location where it is readable and executable by the PostgreSQL server process. Running the import \uf0c1 On the client side you now need to configure the import to point to the correct location of the library on the database server . Add the following line to your your settings/local.php file: @define('CONST_Database_Module_Path', '<directory on the database server where nominatim.so resides>'); Now change the CONST_Database_DSN to point to your remote server and continue to follow the standard instructions for importing .","title":"Advanced Installations"},{"location":"admin/Advanced-Installations/#advanced-installations","text":"This page contains instructions for setting up multiple countries in your Nominatim database.

It is assumed that you have already successfully installed the Nominatim software itself, if not return to the installation page . Configuration setup in settings/local.php \uf0c1 The Nominatim server can be customized via the file settings/local.php in the build directory. Note that this is a PHP file, so it must always start like this: <?php without any leading spaces. There are lots of configuration settings you can tweak. Have a look at settings/default.php for a full list. Most should have a sensible default. Flatnode files \uf0c1 If you plan to import a large dataset (e.g. Europe, North America, planet), you should also enable flatnode storage of node locations. With this setting enabled, node coordinates are stored in a simple file instead of the database. This will save you import time and disk storage. Add to your settings/local.php : @define('CONST_Osm2pgsql_Flatnode_File', '/path/to/flatnode.file'); Replace the second part with a suitable path on your system and make sure the directory exists. There should be at least 64GB of free space. Downloading additional data \uf0c1 Wikipedia/Wikidata rankings \uf0c1 Wikipedia can be used as an optional auxiliary data source to help indicate the importance of OSM features. Nominatim will work without this information but it will improve the quality of the results if this is installed. This data is available as a binary download: cd $NOMINATIM_SOURCE_DIR/data wget https://www.nominatim.org/data/wikimedia-importance.sql.gz The file is about 400MB and adds around 4GB to Nominatim database. Tip If you forgot to download the wikipedia rankings, you can also add importances after the import. Download the files, then run ./utils/setup.php --import-wikipedia-articles and ./utils/update.php --recompute-importance . Great Britain, USA postcodes \uf0c1 Nominatim can use postcodes from an external source to improve searches that involve a GB or US postcode. This data can be optionally downloaded: cd $NOMINATIM_SOURCE_DIR/data wget https://www.nominatim.org/data/gb_postcode_data.sql.gz wget https://www.nominatim.org/data/us_postcode_data.sql.gz Choosing the Data to Import \uf0c1 In its default setup Nominatim is configured to import the full OSM data set for the entire planet. Such a setup requires a powerful machine with at least 64GB of RAM and around 800GB of SSD hard disks. Depending on your use case there are various ways to reduce the amount of data imported. This section discusses these methods. They can also be combined. Using an extract \uf0c1 If you only need geocoding for a smaller region, then precomputed extracts are a good way to reduce the database size and import time. Geofabrik offers extracts for most countries. They even have daily updates which can be used with the update process described below. There are also other providers for extracts . Please be aware that some extracts are not cut exactly along the country boundaries. As a result some parts of the boundary may be missing which means that Nominatim cannot compute the areas for some administrative areas. Dropping Data Required for Dynamic Updates \uf0c1 About half of the data in Nominatim's database is not really used for serving the API. It is only there to allow the data to be updated from the latest changes from OSM. For many uses these dynamic updates are not really required. If you don't plan to apply updates, the dynamic part of the database can be safely dropped using the following command: ./utils/setup.php --drop Note that you still need to provide for sufficient disk space for the initial import. So this option is particularly interesting if you plan to transfer the database or reuse the space later. Reverse-only Imports \uf0c1 If you only want to use the Nominatim database for reverse lookups or if you plan to use the installation only for exports to a photon database, then you can set up a database without search indexes. Add --reverse-only to your setup command above. This saves about 5% of disk space. Filtering Imported Data \uf0c1 Nominatim normally sets up a full search database containing administrative boundaries, places, streets, addresses and POI data. There are also other import styles available which only read selected data: settings/import-admin.style Only import administrative boundaries and places. settings/import-street.style Like the admin style but also adds streets. settings/import-address.style Import all data necessary to compute addresses down to house number level. settings/import-full.style Default style that also includes points of interest. settings/import-extratags.style Like the full style but also adds most of the OSM tags into the extratags column. The style can be changed with the configuration CONST_Import_Style . To give you an idea of the impact of using the different styles, the table below gives rough estimates of the final database size after import of a 2018 planet and after using the --drop option. It also shows the time needed for the import on a machine with 64GB RAM, 4 CPUS and SSDs. Note that the given sizes are just an estimate meant for comparison of style requirements. Your planet import is likely to be larger as the OSM data grows with time. style Import time DB size after drop admin 5h 190 GB 20 GB street 42h 400 GB 180 GB address 59h 500 GB 260 GB full 80h 575 GB 300 GB extratags 80h 585 GB 310 GB You can also customize the styles further. For a description of the style format see the development section . Initial import of the data \uf0c1 Important First try the import with a small extract, for example from Geofabrik . Download the data to import and load the data with the following command from the build directory: ./utils/setup.php --osm-file <data file> --all 2 > & 1 | tee setup.log Note for full planet imports: Even on a perfectly configured machine the import of a full planet takes at least 2 days. Once you see messages with Rank .. ETA appear, the indexing process has started. This part takes the most time. There are 30 ranks to process. Rank 26 and 30 are the most complex. They take each about a third of the total import time. If you have not reached rank 26 after two days of import, it is worth revisiting your system configuration as it may not be optimal for the import. Notes on memory usage \uf0c1 In the first step of the import Nominatim uses osm2pgsql to load the OSM data into the PostgreSQL database. This step is very demanding in terms of RAM usage. osm2pgsql and PostgreSQL are running in parallel at this point. PostgreSQL blocks at least the part of RAM that has been configured with the shared_buffers parameter during PostgreSQL tuning and needs some memory on top of that. osm2pgsql needs at least 2GB of RAM for its internal data structures, potentially more when it has to process very large relations. In addition it needs to maintain a cache for node locations. The size of this cache can be configured with the parameter --osm2pgsql-cache . When importing with a flatnode file, it is best to disable the node cache completely and leave the memory for the flatnode file. Nominatim will do this by default, so you do not need to configure anything in this case. For imports without a flatnode file, set --osm2pgsql-cache approximately to the size of the OSM pbf file (in MB) you are importing. Make sure you leave enough RAM for PostgreSQL and osm2pgsql as mentioned above. If the system starts swapping or you are getting out-of-memory errors, reduce the cache size or even consider using a flatnode file. Verify import finished \uf0c1 Run this script to verify all required tables and indices got created successfully. ./utils/check_import_finished.php Tuning the database \uf0c1 Accurate word frequency information for search terms helps PostgreSQL's query planner to make the right decisions. Recomputing them can improve the performance of forward geocoding in particular under high load. To recompute word counts run: ./utils/update.php --recompute-word-counts This will take a couple of hours for a full planet installation. You can also defer that step to a later point in time when you realise that performance becomes an issue. Just make sure that updates are stopped before running this function. If you want to be able to search for places by their type through special key phrases you also need to enable these key phrases like this: ./ utils / specialphrases . php -- wiki - import > specialphrases . sql psql - d nominatim - f specialphrases . sql Note that this command downloads the phrases from the wiki link above. You need internet access for the step. Installing Tiger housenumber data for the US \uf0c1 Nominatim is able to use the official TIGER address set to complement the OSM house number data in the US. You can add TIGER data to your own Nominatim instance by following these steps. The entire US adds about 10GB to your database. Get preprocessed TIGER 2019 data and unpack it into the data directory in your Nominatim sources: cd Nominatim/data wget https://nominatim.org/data/tiger2019-nominatim-preprocessed.tar.gz tar xf tiger2019-nominatim-preprocessed.tar.gz data-source/us-tiger/README.md explains how the data got preprocessed.

Users have created instructions for other frameworks. We haven't tested those and can't offer support. Docker Docker on Kubernetes Ansible Prerequisites \uf0c1 Software \uf0c1 For compiling: cmake expat proj bzip2 zlib Boost libraries , including system and filesystem PostgreSQL client libraries a recent C++ compiler (gcc 5+ or Clang 3.8+) For running Nominatim: PostgreSQL (9.3+) PostGIS (2.2+) Python 3 Psycopg2 PHP (7.0 or later) PHP-pgsql PHP-intl (bundled with PHP) a webserver (apache or nginx are recommended) For running continuous updates: pyosmium (with Python 3) For running tests: behave nose phpunit >= 7.3 Hardware \uf0c1 A minimum of 2GB of RAM is required or installation will fail. For a full planet import 64GB of RAM or more are strongly recommended. Do not report out of memory problems if you have less than 64GB RAM. For a full planet install you will need at least 800GB of hard disk space (take into account that the OSM database is growing fast). SSD disks will help considerably to speed up import and queries. Even on a well configured machine the import of a full planet takes at least 2 days. Without SSDs 7-8 days are more realistic. Setup of the server \uf0c1 PostgreSQL tuning \uf0c1 You might want to tune your PostgreSQL installation so that the later steps make best use of your hardware. You should tune the following parameters in your postgresql.conf file. shared_buffers = 2GB maintenance_work_mem = (10GB) autovacuum_work_mem = 2GB work_mem = (50MB) effective_cache_size = (24GB) synchronous_commit = off checkpoint_segments = 100 # only for postgresql <= 9.4 max_wal_size = 1GB # postgresql > 9.4 checkpoint_timeout = 10min checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9 The numbers in brackets behind some parameters seem to work fine for 64GB RAM machine. Adjust to your setup. A higher number for max_wal_size means that PostgreSQL needs to run checkpoints less often but it does require the additional space on your disk. Autovacuum must not be switched off because it ensures that the tables are frequently analysed. If your machine has very little memory, you might consider setting: autovacuum_max_workers = 1 and even reduce autovacuum_work_mem further. This will reduce the amount of memory that autovacuum takes away from the import process. For the initial import, you should also set: fsync = off full_page_writes = off Don't forget to reenable them after the initial import or you risk database corruption. Webserver setup \uf0c1 The website/ directory in the build directory contains the configured website. Include the directory into your webbrowser to serve php files from there. Configure for use with Apache \uf0c1 Make sure your Apache configuration contains the required permissions for the directory and create an alias: <Directory \"/srv/nominatim/build/website\" > Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews AddType text/html .php DirectoryIndex search.php Require all granted </Directory> Alias /nominatim /srv/nominatim/build/website /srv/nominatim/build should be replaced with the location of your build directory. After making changes in the apache config you need to restart apache. The website should now be available on http://localhost/nominatim. Configure for use with Nginx \uf0c1 Use php-fpm as a deamon for serving PHP cgi. Install php-fpm together with nginx. By default php listens on a network socket. If you want it to listen to a Unix socket instead, change the pool configuration ( pool.d/www.conf ) as follows: ; Comment out the tcp listener and add the unix socket ; listen = 127 . 0 . 0 . 1 : 9000 listen = / var / run / php5 - fpm . sock ; Ensure that the daemon runs as the correct user listen . owner = www - data listen . group = www - data listen . mode = 0666 Tell nginx that php files are special and to fastcgi_pass to the php-fpm unix socket by adding the location definition to the default configuration. root /srv/nominatim/build/website ; index search.php ; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ @php ; } location @php { fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME \" $document_root$uri.php\" ; fastcgi_param PATH_TRANSLATED \" $document_root$uri.php\" ; fastcgi_param QUERY_STRING $args ; fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock ; fastcgi_index index.php ; include fastcgi_params ; } location ~ [^/]\\.php(/|$) { fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+?\\.php)(/.*) $ ; if (!-f $document_root$fastcgi_script_name ) { return 404 ; } fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php7.3-fpm.sock ; fastcgi_index search.php ; include fastcgi.conf ; } Restart the nginx and php5-fpm services and the website should now be available at http://localhost/ .

The address of my search results contains far-away places that don't belong there. \uf0c1 Nominatim computes the address from two sources in the OpenStreetMap data: from administrative boundaries and from place nodes. Boundaries are the more useful source. They precisely describe an area. So it is very clear for Nominatim if a point belongs to an area or not. Place nodes are more complicated. These are only points without any precise extent. So Nominatim has to take a guess and assume that an address belongs to the closest place node it can find. In an ideal world, Nominatim would not need the place nodes but there are many places on earth where there are no precise boundaries available for all parts that make up an address. This is in particular true for the more local address parts, like villages and suburbs. Therefore it is not possible to completely dismiss place nodes. And sometimes they sneak in where they don't belong. As a OpenStreetMap mapper, you can improve the situation in two ways: if you see a place node for which already an administrative area exists, then you should link the two by adding the node with a 'label' role to the boundary relation. If there is no administrative area, you can add the approximate extent of the place and tag it place= as well. 2. When doing reverse search, the address details have parts that don't contain the point I was looking up. \uf0c1 There is a common misconception how the reverse API call works in Nominatim. Reverse does not give you the address of the point you asked for. Reverse returns the closest object to the point you asked for and then returns the address of that object. Now, if you are close to a border, then the closest object may be across that border. When Nominatim then returns the address, it contains the county/state/country across the border. 3. I get different counties/states/countries when I change the zoom parameter in the reverse query. How is that possible? \uf0c1 This is basically the same problem as in the previous answer. The zoom level influences at which search rank Nominatim starts looking for the closest object. So the closest house number maybe on one side of the border while the closest street is on the other. As the address details contain the address of the closest object found, you might sometimes get one result, sometimes the other for the closest point. 4. Can you return the continent? \uf0c1 Nominatim assigns each map feature one country. Those outside any administrative boundaries are assigned a special no-country. Continents or other super-national administrations (e.g. European Union, NATO, Custom unions) are not supported, see also Administrative Boundary . 5. Can you return the timezone? \uf0c1 See this separate OpenStreetMap-based project Timezone Boundary Builder . 6. I want to download a list of streets/restaurants of a city/region \uf0c1 The Overpass API is more suited for these kinds of queries. That said if you installed your own Nominatim instance you can use the /utils/export.php PHP script as basis to return such lists.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"api/Faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"api/Faq/#api-results","text":"","title":"API Results"},{"location":"api/Faq/#1-the-address-of-my-search-results-contains-far-away-places-that-dont-belong-there","text":"Nominatim computes the address from two sources in the OpenStreetMap data: from administrative boundaries and from place nodes.

Reverse does not give you the address of the point you asked for. Reverse returns the closest object to the point you asked for and then returns the address of that object. Now, if you are close to a border, then the closest object may be across that border. When Nominatim then returns the address, it contains the county/state/country across the border.","title":"2.

The zoom level influences at which search rank Nominatim starts looking for the closest object. So the closest house number maybe on one side of the border while the closest street is on the other.

Additional information requested with extratags=1 and namedetails=1 can be found in extra elements as sub-element of each place. Notes on field values \uf0c1 place_id is not a persistent id \uf0c1 The place_id is created when a Nominatim database gets installed. A single place will have a different value on another server or even when the same data gets re-imported. It's thus not useful to treat it as permanent for later use. The combination osm_type + osm_id is slighly better but remember in OpenStreetMap mappers can delete, split, recreate places (and those get a new osm_id ), there is no link between those old and new ids. Places can also change their meaning without changing their osm_id , e.g. when a restaurant is retagged as supermarket. For a more in-depth discussion see Permanent ID . Nominatim merges some places (e.g. center node of a city with the boundary relation) so osm_type + osm_id + class_name would be more unique. boundingbox \uf0c1 Comma separated list of min latitude, max latitude, min longitude, max longitude. The whole planet would be -90,90,-180,180 . Can we used to pan and center the map on the result, for example with leafletjs mapping library map.fitBounds([[bbox[0],bbox[2]],[bbox[1],bbox[3]]], {padding: [20, 20], maxzoom: 16}); Bounds crossing the antimeridian have a min latitude -180 and max latitude 180, essentially covering the planet (See issue 184 ). addressdetails \uf0c1 Address details in the xml and json formats return a list of names together with a designation label. Per default the following labels may appear: continent country, country_code region, state, state_district, county municipality, city, town, village city_district, district, borough, suburb, subdivision hamlet, croft, isolated_dwelling neighbourhood, allotments, quarter city_block, residental, farm, farmyard, industrial, commercial, retail road house_number, house_name emergency, historic, military, natural, landuse, place, railway, man_made, aerialway, boundary, amenity, aeroway, club, craft, leisure, office, mountain_pass, shop, tourism, bridge, tunnel, waterway They roughly correspond to the classification of the OpenStreetMap data according to either the place tag or the main key of the object.","title":"Place Output Formats"},{"location":"api/Output/#place-output","text":"The /reverse , /search and /lookup API calls produce very similar output which is explained in this section.

Nominatim uses its own data output style 'gazetteer', which differs from the output style created for map rendering. Database Layout \uf0c1 The gazetteer style produces a single table place with the following rows: osm_type - kind of OSM object ( N - node, W - way, R - relation) osm_id - original OSM ID class - key of principal tag defining the object type type - value of principal tag defining the object type name - collection of tags that contain a name or reference admin_level - numerical value of the tagged administrative level address - collection of tags defining the address of an object extratags - collection of additional interesting tags that are not directly relevant for searching geometry - geometry of the object (in WGS84) A single OSM object may appear multiple times in this table when it is tagged with multiple tags that may constitute a principal tag. Take for example a motorway bridge. In OSM, this would be a way which is tagged with highway=motorway and bridge=yes . This way would appear in the place table once with class of highway and once with a class of bridge . Thus the unique key for place is ( osm_type , osm_id , class ). Configuring the Import \uf0c1 How tags are interpreted and assigned to the different place columns can be configured via the import style configuration file ( CONST_Import_style ). This is a JSON file which contains a list of rules which are matched against every tag of every object and then assign the tag its specific role. Configuration Rules \uf0c1 A single rule looks like this: { \"keys\" : [ \"key1\" , \"key2\" , ... ], \"values\" : { \"value1\" : \"prop\" , \"value2\" : \"prop1,prop2\" } } A rule first defines a list of keys to apply the rule to. This is always a list of strings. The string may have four forms. An empty string matches against any key. A string that ends in an asterisk * is a prefix match and accordingly matches against any key that starts with the given string (minus the * ). A suffix match can be defined similarly with a string that starts with a * . Any other string constitutes an exact match. The second part of the rules defines a list of values and the properties that apply to a successful match. Value strings may be either empty, which means that they match any value, or describe an exact match. Prefix or suffix matching of values is not possible. For a rule to match, it has to find a valid combination of keys and values. The resulting property is that of the matched values. The rules in a configuration file are processed sequentially and the first match for each tag wins. A rule where key and value are the empty string is special. This defines the fallback when none of the rules match. The fallback is always used as a last resort when nothing else matches, no matter where the rule appears in the file. Defining multiple fallback rules is not allowed. What happens in this case, is undefined. Tag Properties \uf0c1 One or more of the following properties may be given for each tag: main A principal tag. A new row will be added for the object with key and value as class and type . with_name When the tag is a principal tag ( main property set): only really add a new row, if there is any name tag found (a reference tag is not sufficient, see below). with_name_key When the tag is a principal tag ( main property set): only really add a new row, if there is also a name tag that matches the key of the principal tag. For example, if the main tag is bridge=yes , then it will only be added as an extra row, if there is a tag bridge:name[:XXX] for the same object. If this property is set, all other names that are not domain-specific are ignored. fallback When the tag is a principal tag ( main property set): only really add a new row, when no other principal tags for this object have been found. Only one fallback tag can win for an object. operator When the tag is a principal tag ( main property set): also include the operator tag in the list of names. This is a special construct for an out-dated tagging practise in OSM. Fuel stations and chain restaurants in particular used to have the name of the chain tagged as operator . These days the chain can be more commonly found in the brand tag but there is still enough old data around to warrant this special case. name Add tag to the list of names. ref Add tag to the list of names as a reference. At the moment this only means that the object is not considered to be named for with_name . address Add tag to the list of address tags. If the tag starts with addr: or is_in: , then this prefix is cut off before adding it to the list. postcode Add the value as a postcode to the address tags. If multiple tags are candidate for postcodes, one wins out and the others are dropped. country Add the value as a country code to the address tags. The value must be a two letter country code, otherwise it is ignored. If there are multiple tags that match, then one wins out and the others are dropped. house If no principle tags can be found for the object, still add the object with class = place and type = house . Use this for address nodes that have no other function. interpolation Add this object as an address interpolation (appears as class = place and type = houses in the database). extra Add tag to the list of extra tags. skip Skip the tag completely. Useful when a custom default fallback is defined or to define exceptions to rules. A rule can define as many of these properties for one match as it likes. For example, if the property is \"main,extra\" then the tag will open a new row but also have the tag appear in the list of extra tags. There are a number of pre-defined styles in the settings/ directory. It is advisable to start from one of these styles when defining your own. Changing the Style of Existing Databases \uf0c1 There is normally no issue changing the style of a database that is already imported and now kept up-to-date with change files. Just be aware that any change in the style applies to updates only. If you want to change the data that is already in the database, then a reimport is necessary.","title":"OSM Data Import"},{"location":"develop/Import/#osm-data-import","text":"OSM data is initially imported using osm2pgsql.

Simply put, if there are two results for a search query which are otherwise equal, then the result with the lower search rank will be appear higher in the result list. Search ranks are not so important these days because many well-known places use the Wikipedia importance ranking instead. Address rank \uf0c1 The address rank describes where a place shows up in an address hierarchy. Usually only administrative boundaries and place nodes and areas are eligible to be part of an address. All other objects have an address rank of 0. Note that the search rank of a place plays a role in the address computation as well. When collecting the places that should make up the address parts then only places are taken into account that have a lower address rank than the search rank of the base object. Rank configuration \uf0c1 Search and address ranks are assigned to a place when it is first imported into the database. There are a few hard-coded rules for the assignment: postcodes follow special rules according to their length boundaries that are not areas and railway=rail are dropped completely the following are always search rank 30 and address rank 0: highway nodes landuse that is not an area Other than that, the ranks can be freely assigned via the JSON file defined with CONST_Address_Level_Config according to their type and the country they are in.
