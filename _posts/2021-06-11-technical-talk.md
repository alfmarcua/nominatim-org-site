title: "Nominatim tech talk: Finding places"
author: Sarah Hoffmann (lonvia)

Last month I was invited by [CodeOp](https://codeop.tech/) to give a technical
introduction to geocoding and Nominatim to their students. This talk is now
available online.

The talk gave a short introduction of the OpenStreetMap project and the
open-source universe that has developed around it. It then went on to look
into the specifics of Nominatim. It discussed the general architecture
of the software and the design decisions behind it, as well as the selected
challenges of searching through a huge geographical database. There were
also some insights into practical aspects of open-source development and
advice on how to get involved.
