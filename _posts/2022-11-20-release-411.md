title: "Nominatim 4.1.1 released"
author: Sarah Hoffmann (lonvia)

We are happy to announce a new release 4.1.1 of Nominatim. This is a bugfix
release which resolves some smaller issues around updates of databases and
search.

This release collects a number of smaller bugfixes:

* fix minimum number of retrieved results to be at least 10
* fix search for combinations of special term + name (e.g Hotel Bellevue)
* do not return interpolations without a parent street on reverse search
* improve invalidation of linked places on updates
* fix address parsing for interpolation lines
* make sure socket timeouts are respected during replication (working around a bug in some versions of pyosmium)

Updating from any version between 3.6.x and 4.1.x to the new release is
straightforward. Please follow the instructions from the
[migration guide](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/admin/Migration/).

### Fixing a potential failure during updates

Please note that this release also fixes a potential crash of the update
process when handling `addr:interpolation` updates with an illegal value. If
you see an error message like this while running updates:

``` sh
psycopg2.errors.InvalidTextRepresentation: invalid input syntax for type smallint: "12-2"
```

then some illegal data has found its way into your database. You need to first
remove the bad data by running the following SQL command (using psql):

``` sql
DELETE FROM location_property_osmline
  WHERE address->'interpolation' not in ('odd', 'even', 'all')
        and not address->'interpolation' similar to '[1-9]'
```

Then update Nominatim to the latest 4.1.1 version and restart updates.
