We are happy to announce a new release 4.1.0 of Nominatim. After many months
of stress testing in production, the ICU tokenizer introduced in the
last release is now the default. The release also brings improved
handling for house numbers and postcodes.

The [4.0](2021-11-03-release-40.md) release saw one of the most extensive
overhauls of the Nominatim code with the introduction of the ICU tokenizer.
In the last months, we have stress-tested this code on the OSMF's servers
at https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org. There are no major incidents to report.
The code did very well for the thousands of requests the servers get. Users
did report smaller issues and suggestions for improvements, which we have
continuously implemented in the last months. With this release the new code
is ready for wider use and from now, will be used per default when you set
up a new installation.

Using the flexible framework that the ICU tokenizer provides, the code now
also has much improved handling of house numbers and postcodes. The
`addr:housenumber` tag is checked for obvious errors. Postcodes are checked
against the acceptable format of each country and discarded if they do not
match. These changes greatly reduce the number of odd results that apparently
do not fit a search query. Also, Nominatim no longer cares about spaces in
house numbers and postcodes. That will make it a lot easier to find addresses.

If you already have a Nominatim database running, you can update to the latest
release according to our [migration instructions](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/admin/Migration/).
However, to profit from the ICU tokenizer or the improved housenumber and
postcode handling, a reimport is required.
