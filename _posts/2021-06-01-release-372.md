There is now a bug fix release 3.7.2 of Nominatim available.

This fixes some issues when running the API on systems with older PHP versions
and re-enables writing logs of database updates. Furthermore the status API
no longer throws an exception when for some reason the database date could
not be determined.

Users running Nominatim on Centos 7 or Ubuntu 18.04 are strongly encouraged
to update to this latest release. When updating from a 3.7.x release,
building and installing the new release is sufficient to update.
