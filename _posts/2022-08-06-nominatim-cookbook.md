Many people know Nominatim simply as a web service, while in fact it is
a powerful geocoding software. There are many ways to adapt your personal
installation to your specific needs. To make it easier to use the full
potential of Nominatim, the website now has a new Cookbook
section.

Under the [Cookbook]({% link tutorials.md %}) menu you will in the future be able to
find tutorials for customizing your Nominatim installation, how-tos how
to use your own Nominatim API on websites, batch geocoding and other less
conventional uses.

The first [tutorial about transliteration]({% link _tutorials/customize-transliteration.md %})
shows how to extend the ICU tokenizer with your own custom Python code.

The Cookbook also collects talks and workshops about Nominatim. There you
find everything from gentle introductions to geocoding to talks about the
internals of the software.
